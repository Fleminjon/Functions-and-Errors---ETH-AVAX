This solidity program demonstrates the use of require, revert, and assert functions.

## Description

This is a smart contract written in solidity that demonstrate the use of the functions require, revert, and assert. It is a great way for beginners to start learning about how error handling works in Solidity. With this foundation, we can create more complex programs.

## Getting Started


* this was made in Remix Ethereum IDE website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

### Executing program

* Once you are on the website, import the .sol there.
* To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to whatever compatible version is written on the top of the .sol code, and then click on the "Compile ErrorHandling.sol" button.
* Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MyContract" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.
* On the deployed contracts, you can see the functions included.
* You may test the functions by adding any value for the user input.
